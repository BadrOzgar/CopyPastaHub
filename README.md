🍝 CopyPastaHub – Cloning for Fun & Learning
Welcome to CopyPastaHub, where we unapologetically clone, tweak, and learn! No shame in copying—as long as you understand what you're pasting. 😆

🤔 What’s This Repo About?
This repo is a playground for:

Cloning interesting GitHub projects.
Tweaking them to see what breaks (and how to fix it).
Learning real-world coding practices.
🔥 Why?
Because copy-pasting is the first step toward understanding and improving. We study great code, modify it, and become better developers. Plus, it’s fun.

🚀 How to Use This Repo
Find a project in the repo.
Clone it (git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CopyPastaHub.git).
Mess with the code – break it, fix it, make it yours.
Share what you learned!
